    ```
3.  Run the following command:
    ```powershell
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```
4.  Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Option 2: VS Code Live Server
If you are using VS Code:
1.  Open the `index.html` file.
2.  Right-click and select "Open with Live Server" (if the extension is installed).
